**Unit 6: Applications of the Derivative** <span id="6"></span> 
*With a sufficient amount of sophisticated machinery under your belt,
you will now start to look at how differentiation can be used to solve
problems in various applied settings.  Optimization is an important
notion in fields like biology, economics, and physics when we want to
know when growth is maximized, for example.*  *In addition to methods we
use to solve problems directly, we can also use the derivative to find
approximate solutions to problems.  You will explore two such methods in
this section: Newton's method and differentials.*

**6.2 Related Rates** <span id="6.2"></span> 
*Note: You now know how to take the derivative with respect to the
independent variable.  In other words, you know how to determine a
function’s rate of change when given the input’s rate of change.  But
what if the independent variable was itself a function?  What if, for
example, the input was a function of time?  How do we identify how the
function changes as time changes?  This subunit will explore the answers
to these questions.*

**6.3 Newton's Method** <span id="6.3"></span> 
*Note: Newton's Method is a process by which we estimate the roots of a
real-valued function.  You may remember the bisection method, whereby we
find a root by creating smaller and smaller intervals.  Newton's Method
uses the derivative in order to account for both the speed at which the
function changes and its actual position.  This creates an algorithm
that can help us identify the location of roots even more quickly.*  
    
 *Newton's Method requires that you start “sufficiently close” (a
somewhat arbitrary specification that varies from problem to problem) to
the actual root in order to estimate it with accuracy.  If you start too
far from the root, an algorithm can be led awry in certain situations.*
