**Unit 5: Curve Sketching** <span id="5"></span> 
*This section will ask you to apply a little critical thinking to the
topics this course has covered thus far.  To properly sketch a curve,
you must analyze the function and its first and second derivatives in
order to obtain information about how the function behaves, taking into
account its intercepts, asymptotes (vertical and horizontal), maximum
values, minimum values, points of inflection, and the respective
intervals between each of these.  After collecting this information, you
will need to piece it all together in order to sketch an approximation
of the original function.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 10.25 hours to complete.

-   Use critical points to find local extrema.
-   Use the first and second derivative tests to find intervals of
    increase and decrease and to find information about concavity and
    inflection points.
