**Unit 2: Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative** <span
id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study the instantaneous rate of change of a
function.  Motivated by this concept, you will develop the notion of
limits, continuity, and the derivative.  The limit asks the
question, “What does the function do as the independent variable becomes
closer and closer to a certain value?”  In simpler terms, the limit is
the “natural tendency” of a function.  The limit is incredibly important
due to its relationship to the derivative, the integral, and countless
other key mathematical concepts.  A strong understanding of limits is
essential to the field of mathematics.*  
  
 *A derivative is a description of how a function changes as its input
varies.  In the case of a straight line, this description is the same at
every point, which is why we can describe the slope of an entire
function when it is linear.  You can also describe the slope of
nonlinear functions.  The slope, however, will not be constant; it will
change as the independent variable changes.*
