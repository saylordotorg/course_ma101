**Unit 1: Analytic Geometry** <span id="1"></span> 
*Most of the material in this unit will be review.  However, the notions
of points, lines, circles, distance, and functions will be central in
everything that follows.  Lines are basic geometric objects which will
be of great importance in the study of differential calculus in the
study of tangent lines and linear approximations.*  
  
 *We will also take a look at the practical uses of mathematical
functions.  This course will use mathematical models, or structures,
that predict practical situations in order to describe and study a
number of real-life problems and situations.  They are essential to the
development of every major business and every scientific field in the
modern world.*
