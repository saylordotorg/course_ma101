**Unit 3: Rules for Finding Derivatives** <span id="3"></span> 
*Computing a derivative requires computing a limit.  Because limit
computations can be rather involved, we like to minimize the amount of
work we have to do in practice.  In this unit, you will build your skill
using some rules for differentiation which will speed up your
calculations of derivatives.  In particular, you will see how to
differentiate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and composition of
two or more functions.  You will also learn rules for differentiating
power functions, including polynomial and root functions.*

**3.3 The Product Rule** <span id="3.3"></span>

    Rules for Finding Derivatives: “Section 3.3: The Product Rule”**

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read Section 3.3
    (pages 60-61) in its entirety.  The naïve assumption is that the
    derivative of a product of two functions is the product of the
    derivatives of the two functions.  This assumption is false.  In
    this reading, you will see that the derivative of a product is
    slightly more complicated, but that it follows a definite rule
    called the product rule.  
        
     This reading should take you approximately 30 minutes to
    complete.

    (pages 62-65) in its entirety.  As with product of two functions,
    the derivative of a quotient of two functions is not simply the
    quotient of the two derivatives.  This reading will introduce you to
    the quotient rule for differentiating a quotient of two functions.
     In particular, it will allow you to find the derivative of any
    rational function.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read Section 3.5
    (pages 65-69) in its entirety.  The chain rule explains how the
