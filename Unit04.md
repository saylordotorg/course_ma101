**Unit 4: Transcendental Functions** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will investigate the derivatives of trigonometric,
inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.  Along
the way, you will develop a technique of differentiation called implicit
differentiation.  Aside from allowing you to compute derivatives of
inverse function, implicit differentiation will also be important in
studying related rates problems later on.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read Section 4.9
    (pages 91-94) in its entirety.  In this reading, implicit
    differentiation and the Pythagorean identity are used to compute the
    derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions.  You should notice
    that the same techniques can be used to find derivatives of other
    inverse functions as well.

**4.10 Limits Revisited** <span id="4.10"></span>

    Revisited”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/calculus_04_Transcendental_Functions.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read Section 4.10
    (pages 94-97) in its entirety.  In this section, you will learn how
    derivatives relate back to limits.  Limits of Indeterminate Forms
    (or limits of functions that, when evaluated, tend to 0/0 or ∞/∞)
    have previously been beyond our grasp.  Using L’Hopital’s Rule, you
    will find that these limits are attainable with derivatives.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read Section 4.11
    (pages 99-102) in its entirety.  In this reading, you are introduced
    to the hyperbolic trigonometric functions.  These functions, which
    appear in many engineering and physics applications, are specific
    combinations of exponential functions which have properties similar
    to those that the ordinary trigonometric functions have.  
        
     This reading should take you approximately one hour to complete.
